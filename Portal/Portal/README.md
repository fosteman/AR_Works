#  AR Portal in Arkit 2
The portal app I am building with you here lets user place a virtual doorway to a futuristic room, somewhere on a horozintal plane in the real world. You can walk in and out of this virtual room, and you can explore what's inside.

1. Setup an ARSession
2. Detect and render horizontal planes using ARKit
