#  KioskAd
It's an ARKit-powered iOS app whose primary purpose is to provide a virtual, interactive billboard, which can be used to promote and recommend products, propose personalized discounts, and show video ads and ictures. The billbord is triggered by a QR code, exposed right outside a Kiosk's window.

Kiosk is a public boutique where target business is taking place.

Because tourists are usually distracted, Core Location is used to notify the user when they are close to Kiosk, and Beacons to enable auto QR code detection when the user is very close to the triggering point. Although ARKit supports an image detection feature, QR Code comes in handy becuase custom data may be embedded.
